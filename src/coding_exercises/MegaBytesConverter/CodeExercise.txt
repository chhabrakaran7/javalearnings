// Code exercise //

* Write a method called "printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes" that:
    > has 1 "int" type parameter named "kiloBytes"
    > should not return anything (void)
    > needs to calculate MBs and KBs from the supplied "kiloBytes" parameter
    > Print a message in format "XX KB = YY MB and ZZ KB"
        >> XX : Supplied KB
        >> YY : calculated MB
        >> ZZ : calculated remaining KBs
    > If "kiloBytes" < 0;
        >> print "Invalid Value"
NOTE:
1. All methods should be defined as public static
2. 1 MB = 1024 KB
