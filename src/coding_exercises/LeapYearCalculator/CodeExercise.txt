// Code Exercise //

* Write a method "isLeapYear" that:
    > has 1 "int" type parameter named "year"
    > "year" should be >= 1 or <= 9999
    > if "year" is out of [1-9999];
        >> return false.
    > if "year" is in range;
        >> check if the year is a leap year; ["return true" if yes; else "return false"]
Note:
A year is a leap year when it is:
1. evenly divisible by 4 [mandatory]
2. evenly divisible 100 and 400 both:
    > if divisible by 100;
        >> then it needs to be divisible by 400 as well.
