// Code Exercise //

* Write a method printYearsAndDays:
    > with parameter of type long named "minutes"
    > The method should not return anything (void)
    > it needs to calculate the years and days from the minutes parameter.
    > If the "minutes" < 0;
        >> print text "Invalid Value"
    > else;
        >> it needs to print a message in the format "XX min = YY y and ZZ d".

EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

* printYearsAndDays(525600);  → should print "525600 min = 1 y and 0 d"
* printYearsAndDays(1051200); → should print "1051200 min = 2 y and 0 d"
* printYearsAndDays(561600);  → should print "561600 min = 1 y and 25 d"
