// Code exercise //

* Write a method called "toMilesPerHour" that:
    > has 1 "double" type parameter named "kilometersPerHour"
    > should return rounded value of calculation type long
    > if "kilometersPerHour" < 0;
        >> return value "-1" to indicate an invalid value
    > if "kilometersPerHour" > 0;
        >> calculate value of miles per hour, round it and return it.
        >> Use "Math.round" method for rounding off. Math.round returns the closest round value.
* Write a method called "printConversion" that:
    > has 1 "double" type parameter named "kilometersPerhour"
    > should not return anything (void)
    > needs to calculate "milesPerHour" from the "kilometersPerHour"
    > needs to print message in "XX km/h = YY mi/h" format
        >> "XX" is original value of "kilometersPerHour" and "YY" is rounded value of converted "milesPerHour"
    > if "kilometersPerHour" < 0;
        >> print text "Invalid Value"
NOTE:
1. All methods should be defined as public static
2. 1 mile per hour = 1.609 kilometers per hour
