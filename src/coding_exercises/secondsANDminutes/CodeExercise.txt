// Code Exercise //

* Create a method "getDurationString" with:
    > two int type parameters "minutes" and "seconds"
    > validate "minutes" >= 0 and;
    > validate "seconds" >= 0 and <= 59
    > if either of above is not true;
        >> return "Invalid value"
    > else;
        >> Calculate how many hours, minutes and seconds are equal to the minutes and seconds passed.
        >> Ex: minutes (passed) = 35; seconds (passed) = 45 should return: 00h 35m 45s
        >> Format: XXh YYm ZZs

* Create a second method "getDurationString" with:
    > one parameter "seconds"
    > validate "seconds" >= 0
    > if not true;
        >> return "Invalid value"
    > else;
        >> Calculate how many minutes are there in seconds and;
        >> call the other overloaded method passing the correct minutes and seconds calculated so that it can calculate correctly.
