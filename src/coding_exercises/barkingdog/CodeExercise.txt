// Code Exercise //

* We have a dog that likes to bark.
* Write a method "shouldWakeUp" that:
    > has 2 parameters:
        >> 1st parameter should be "boolean" type and name "barking" [represents if dog barking or not]
        >> 2nd parameter should be "int" type and represents "hourOfDay" [Range: 0-23]
    > if dog is barking "before 8 hours" or "after 22 hours";
        >> wake up the dog and return true
    > else;
        >> return false
    > if hourOfDay < 0 or > 23;
        >> return false
